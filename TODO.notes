# Pipelines Repo
- Add protection to the release branch
- Decide what default branch to use for dev

-->If user creates a repo from the template, will it inherit the branches?


# Code Build
- Script to create run process lambda function and sns topics
- Script to create cron lambda on schedule per config settings.
- Lambda handler function to add to the docker lambda image - modify for cron, modify for vap

# MHKDR Integration
Need a script to create a dataset in MHKDR and then set up a DataSync resource to keep the tsdat output bucket in sync with the MHKDR dataset bucket.
DataSync can be created via CDK or boto3 (TBD).


rename code workspace file to tsdat-cdk

# Testing Steps
1. Create my forked repos in the carinatest org DONE
2. Create codestar CodeStarConnection DONE
3. test adding code pipeline to the Stack DONE
4. test that the build will build the images correctly
5. test creating lambda with file trigger by hand (including access to buckets and event trigger)
6. test creating lambda with cron trigger by hand
7. Add the create lambda function to the build

# Maybe add create branches to the README Steps
- See if branches are inherited from the template (they did not inherit when I forked).
  If not, then add steps in the README to create the branches

Do I have to add a web hook by hand in order for a commit to GitHub to trigger the
AWS build?

# Lambda Function
- Fix lambda logging.  See if I can override this in the lambda container so we aren't 
logging for every log statement in the code.

- Add last modified functions to FileStorageS3

- Take out the code that tries to get the config file from the cache, since we can look
up the config file from our build pipelines config object.

                    config = PipelineConfig.from_yaml(config_file)
                    pipeline = config.instantiate_pipeline()
                    inputs = input_keys if clump else [input_key]
                    pipeline.run(inputs)

- Figure out event structure for S3 and cron events and then parse the events properly
to pull out the right parameters.
